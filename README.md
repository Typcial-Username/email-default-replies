# Email Default Responses

If you send a lot of emails, and a lot of them end up having the same boilerplate content, it can be tedious to type in each email manually. Email Default Responces fixes this problem by adding a custom button to web-based email clients to allow for default responces, increasing the productivity for email.

## Current Features

- Add custom reaponses
- Responces automatially sync to the browser
- Edit responses if needed

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Go you your favorite email client (currently supports Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo)
3. Press the "Default Responce Button"
4. Add or choose a default responce
5. Finish composing
6. Send the email

## Roadmap

[] Allow reordering
[] Allow exporing responces
[] Integate AI for response generation
